Webfilter Domain Cleansing

Web filtering software doesn't like new domains. But if those domains point to known good ones, the web filters will start to trust them. 

1. Register a fake domain
2. Create a CNAME for www.fake.com pointing to a legitimate site
3. Go to proxy vendors, submit url for testing

	1. Takes hours to days

4. Switch at last minute to real site
